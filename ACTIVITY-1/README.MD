# Swag Labs E-Commerce Website


## Objective

The objective of this project is to provide automated testing of the Swag Labs E-Commerce website using Selenium WebDriver and Python in order to ensure that all critical flows/features are reliable. Through this automation, any issues which impact the way the user interacts with the application can be identified.  

## Scope
The following core functionalities of the E-commerce application will be tested:

### Login: 
- Verify user authentication and error handling for incorrect credentials.
### Product Filtering: 
- Ensure users can filter products accurately based on criteria (e.g., name, price).
### Product Grid and Detailed Views:
- Verify product details and ensure data is consistent across listings.
### Cart:
- Test adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.
### Checkout: 
- Validate the checkout workflow, payment options, and form validation.

## Tools and Technologies
+ **Python:** Programming language for writing automated tests.
+ **Pytest:** Executing automated test cases.
+ **Selenium WebDriver:** Automating web browser interactions.
+ **ConfigParser:** Managing configuration settings.
+ **HTML Reports:** Capture and display test executions in HTML format.

## Prerequisites
1. Python v3.13.0: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Virtual Environment: Used to manage dependencies in a stable environment
4. pip: To check if you have `pip` available by running the following:
    - Unix/MacOS: `python3 -m pip --version`
    - Windows: `py -m pip --version`
        - If pip isnâ€™t installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library using: `py -m ensurepip --default-pip`

## Getting Started
Once the prerequisites are met, follow the bellow commands:

```bash 
#Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:mdkgray/QA-Tech-Test.git

#Ensure you have the latest code
git fetch
git pull origin

#Navigate to the project 
cd QA-TECH-TEST

#Create and activate a new virtual environment 
python3 -m venv {{NAME_OF_YOUR_VENV}}
source {{NAME_OF_YOUR_VENV}}/bin/activate 

#Install project requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have downloaded the correct chrome webdriver version [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and ensure you either specify the path to your ChromeDiver in your code or add the ChromeDriver to your system's PATH. 

Add to your system PATH by:
- Open Environment Variables:
- Search for "Environment Variables" in your Start menu.
- Edit the Path variable (under System Variables).
- Add the directory path where `chromedriver.exe` is located (e.g., C:\chromedriver).
- Click OK to save.
